# Online Ticket Checker
- Online Ticket Checker is a digital ticket checking app built in Java (NetBeans IDE and SQLite database) which aims to digitalize the manual checking (currently done by paper ticket charts) of train ticket reservations in India.
- This app can help the TTE check tickets faster, reduce the number of TTEs, collect fines from rule violators and generate reports for the Indian Railways.
- Most importantly this application can help reduce the wastage of paper by eliminating ticket charts.

# Features of Online Ticket Checker
## Login
- Contains two fields to enter username and password
- Twol buttons, one to log in and one to exit the system
- Appropriate exception handling done to handle incorrect and empty inputs
- Checks credentials with the database then logs in the user

## Select train
- We have a drop down to select the train number for which the TTE needs to check tickets
- After selection of train number the train name is automatically filled by mapping the selected train number to its name and all the coaches of that train is pulled from the database using a query
- We have a JDateChooser from JCalendar which can be used to pick the date of travel

## Passenger details
- There is a JTable which displays all the passenger details who are travelling on the specified coach and date taken from the database using a query.
- The same passenger details are queried for any date selected as this is just a prototype and the entries are just dummies.
- When we click on a passenger record his name is displayed on the text box and you can now check or uncheck the ticket.
- You can check the tickets by clicking on the check checkbox and clicking OK. The status column turns green and changes status to 'Checked'
- Unchecking the checkbox and clicking OK reverts the checked status back to unchecked (Red)
- You can also sort the passengers based on either seat number or destination (done by a query to update the database). Sorting by destination can help the TTE check the tickets of the customers who will be exiting the train soon in order (Priority)

## Routes
- Displays the route of the train from the database by performing a query and displaying on a table
- Contains station name, Arrival and Departure

## Fines
- Opens a form in which you can enter details for a fine for rule violators
- Contains Name, Reason and Amount
- Appropriate exception handling done to take care of empty inputs and very high fine amounts
- Clicking collect fine sends the details to the database and the details can be use to create reports

## Reports
- Reports of checked, unchecked and fined passengers taken from the database using multiple queries
- Details can be sent to Indian Railways for their further use.
- After reports generation the fines table is truncated, all metadata is deleted so it will be empty for the next checking process.

# Future ideas
- Bringing in scanning options so ID proof can be scanned and automatic verification/checking can be done.
- Controls which do not require a TTE. Automatic detection of ID proof if placed on the entrance of a coach.
- Developing this prototype on Android so it can be used as an Android app. (More popular and easily distributable).
- Automatic allotment of RAC passengers quickly based on the available seats which reduces waiting time and increases satisfaction of more customers

# Acknowledgements
- Idea was from me but the style and technogies for development are inspired by Youtube channel Tutus Funny. Some ideas were taken from their Railway Reservation System and some from their Bus Booking system.
